# RobloxServerJoinerMk2
This is a W.I.P script that allows you to go to any roblox server locale of your choosing. Originally made by Exilon24. There are a LOT of issues with the code and any improvements would be greatly accepted

## Installation:
Open your terminal and move to the directory you wish to install this tool and clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/TheConfusedlol/RobloxServerJoinerMk2.git` <br>
if you have an error trying to run the command, simply install git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) <br>
Then type cd and tab until you see the directory it was installed into and run pip install -r requirements.txt. <br>

# Finding the roblox cookie
Download a cookie editor extension. [I use this one](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm?hl=en)
Go to roblox
Log into the account you want the cookie for
Open the extension and copy your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie. FInd the folder the script is located at, typically Drive/Users/(username)/RboloxServerFinder and open up RobloxSeverFinder.py in notepad and paste it into the ROBLOXSECCURITYCOOKIE line:

 <br/>
**Do not show this string to anyone, doing so will allow them to log into your account. If you do share it, use the extension to clear your cookies and re-login to your account.**

## Entering desired city and region  (Florida used as an example)
The program requires some settings to be set. Open up roServerFinder.py in a text editor (notepad, vim, anything really). There are 2 fields you need to set (starting line 7):

```
ServerRegion = "US"
RegionCity = "Miami"
ServerRegionSymbol = "FL"
```

Make sure to save your changes before running the script.

## Addendum: Handling Cities Without States
When specifying a city and region, remember that some cities, like Tokyo or London, are major urban centers and do not belong to a state or province. For these cases, you can use the following format:

```
ServerRegion = "JP"             # Country code (e.g., "JP" for Japan)
RegionCity = "Tokyo"            # City name only for cities without a state
ServerRegionSymbol = "TK"         # Use the symbol for the reigon city.
```
# Non-working/troublesome  servers:
Portland, Oregon (redirects to other servers for some reason) <br>
Tokyo, Japan

## Usage
Then go to the directory roServerFinder.py by doing cd ro and then pressing the Tab key to autofill the folder. <br>
run `python roServerFinder.py`

and enter the game ID e.g: https://www.roblox.com/games/15069312471/LifeLike-Disasters game ID is 15069312471

This will open a browser window, requesting to join a roblox game. It will prompt you to allow roblox to open. If you decline, roblox will not open. The browser window will automatically close after you join.
# Safety
I understand that it can be concerning to give your Roblox security information to a random piece of code from the internet. I want to assure you that this script will not hack your account. It's designed solely to help you join the servers you want to play on.
